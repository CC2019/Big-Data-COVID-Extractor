After we get the result csv files in directory "Stock Data Processing" and 
"Case Number Data Processing", we need one more merge to get the 
final result csv file.

If you want to test it by yourself, you should keep "merged stock price.csv" 
, "new_case_number.csv" and "Merge_Stock_Case_Number.ipynb" in the same 
directory. Then you run "Merge_Stock_Case_Number.ipynb" you will get the 
final result csv file named "combined data.csv". Which will be used for our 
data analysis.
