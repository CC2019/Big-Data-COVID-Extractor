# Big-Data-COVID-Extractor
This is the repo for our project of Big Data course.
In each directory, there's data files and python code (.ipynb) 

For stocks data preprocessing, you should focus on these 3 directories:
"Stock Data Processing"
"Case Number Data Processing"
"Combine of Stock and Case Number Data"

You need to firstly open "Stock Data Processing" or "Case Number Data Processing" to get results, 
then you run the code in "Combine of Stock and Case Number Data" with the results you got in the
two directories above. You will get the final result. Each Directory has a "readme.txt" to guide
your test.
